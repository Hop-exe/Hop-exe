<h1 align="center">The Burrow System</h1>

We are a 19 year old system that isn't very social online. Pony can depend on who's fronting but really we switch between whatever whenever because we like to show off our ponies lmao, not much to say other than don't be weird and we don't plan to keep any ponytown friends close/talk to them often. So if you wanna be FRIENDS friends you'll probably have to carry the work until we decide ur cool? If that makes sense
We just don't really like the ponytown community as a whole, we only play for the character creation/people watching/making fun of people ngl
