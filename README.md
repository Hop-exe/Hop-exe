<h1 align="center">The SnowBurrow System</h1>

We are a 19 year old system that isn't very social online. Pony can depend on who's fronting but really we switch between whatever whenever because we like to show off our ponies lmao, not much to say other than don't be weird?? If you wanna be FRIENDS friends you'll probably have to carry the work until we decide ur cool? If that makes sense
We just don't really like the ponytown community as a whole, we only play for the character creation/people watching ngl
