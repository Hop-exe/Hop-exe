<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Melanie...</h1>
<h3 align="center">AKA, The Burrow System</h3>

- We are a 19 year old system that isn't very social online. Pony can depend on who's fronting but really we switch between whatever whenever because we like to show off our ponies lmao, not much to say other than don't be weird and we don't plan to keep any ponytown friends close/talk to them often. So if you wanna be FRIENDS friends you'll probably have to carry the work until we decide ur cool? If that makes sense
- We just don't really like the ponytown community as a whole, we only play for the character creation/people watching/making fun of people ngl

- Also if you identify as an irl/kin/yumeshipper/whatever, interact with your own caution in mind because while I may respect you and that you identify as such, those identity goes against my moral values and, while I may be polite and refer to you with names/pronouns/etc you wish, I try to keep my conversations and social life grounded in reality. I hold this opinion based off experience both personally and as a third party to my friends' experiences. You are free to ask in-game why I hold these beleifs, but do not expect or demand a response.
- This mostly applies to "non-sharing" people/people who believe in "doubles", but even if you are neither keep this in mind. I only make exceptions for close friends as I have explicit consent and ability to keep them grounded until they can seek help
